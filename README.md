# Synapse X Script Editor

# This is broken because you need to have original Synapse files installed and these are not owned by me.

*A somewhat archive of the original Synapse X script editor by Synapse Softworks LLC.*

*If you are an employee at Synapse Softworks LLC or are an affiliate with Synapse, 
please note that this is only an HTML document stored in the original
Synapse X client from about 2021 or 2022 that allows you to see if your
Roblox Lua/Luau script works by showing colors, similar to the Roblox Studio
client.*

`This does not need to be used with only Roblox, as I believe normal Lua works too.` ***This is NOT confirmed***


*Thank you for taking your time and reading this *important* message.*
